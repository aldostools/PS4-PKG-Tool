üí° **Personal Note**  
My daughter is currently battling cancer and has relapsed after month of remission.  
No more treatment available for her here. Her only remaining treatment option is to join a clinical study overseas.  
If you‚Äôve found this project useful and would like to support us on this difficult journey, any help would mean a lot.  
Thank you, and I wish health and happiness to everyone who supports. üôè

# PS4 PKG Tool

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool/total.svg)]()

This tool allows us to display PS4 PKG library, manage and perform various operations on PS4 PKG.  
Suggestions are welcome. Report any bugs [here](https://github.com/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool/issues).

**This is not a software which allows you to get free PS4 game.**

# Requirement
- [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

# Features
- Scan and view your collection of PS4 PKG library in grid view.
- View PKG information, such as param.sfo information, trophy list, and entries.
- Filter grid view by category (Game, Patch, Addon, App).
- View PKG change information.
- View and extract PKG data.
- Extract PKG background image and icon.
- Extract trophy icon.
- Set backport label or remarks to PKG.
- Check for duplicate PKG.
- Rename PKG to a readable format using available naming presets or a custom naming format.

- Export PKG collection list to an Excel file.
- View information and download official update PKG.
- Install/uninstall PKG from PS4 via network using Remote Package Installer.

# How to use Remote Package Installer
This is only compatible with PS4 firmware that can run Flatz's Remote Package Installer app. Split update PKG files are currently not supported.

- Open the program settings.
- Set the IP addresses for your PC and PS4.
- Install Node.js and the http-server module (Ensure that Node.js is allowed through the firewall).
- If you are unable to install the http-server module via the PS4 PKG Tool, try restarting the PS4 PKG Tool and reinstalling the module. Alternatively, you can manually install it by running the command `npm install http-server -g` in the command prompt.
- Save the changes and exit the program settings.
- Launch the Remote Package Installer app on your PS4.
- Select the PKG file you wish to install, right-click on it, and choose 'Send PKG to PS4'.
